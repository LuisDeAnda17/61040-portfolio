# Assignment 1

## Domains 
### Focus Domains
These are the primary domains I will be considering for possible problems. 

- Classwork: Every student deals with classwork; however, scheduling when to do homework can become tough when you have other events going on in life. With most classes having different layout for accessing information, such as different Canvas or website layouts, finding the same information can become tedious.

- Community Management: Living within a community can be great when people help maintain it. Within my living community, there a number of responsibilities assigned to each person from buying ingredients for the weeks meal plan to reminding people of the weekend's chores. Something that could help the community with these responsibilities could improve the efficiency such tasks are done.

- Carpooling/ Car Sharing: At the beginning and end of each semester, I've noticed that a lot of people use a ride service, such as Uber or Lyft, to go from campus to the airport or vice versa. With the amount that occur at roughly the same time, the ability to share the same trip would save money for various people.

### Domains Considered
These are other domains I considered that have problems I considered solving. 
- Reading Books: My family and I used to enjoy reading, but it can be difficult to find good books or remember what we may have already read.

- Dietary Log: Tracking your calorie intake and managing how many times you order take out or cook for yourself can aid people in maintaining a healthier lifestyle.

- Video Games: My friends and I enjoy playing video games together; however, sometimes we have difficulty choosing which game to play next and when.

- Gym/Working out: It can be tough to keep track of workout routines, and one can forget when they decided to workout especially when they first begin or have sudden events going on in their life. 

- Meetings: The ability to schedule meetings is helpful when needing to discuss important matters.

- Finances: Managing your finances can be tough to learn and when doing calculations, something could be forgotten or miscalculated and be difficult to reintegrate.

- Sleep Manager: During the school year, my sleep schedule can become messed up as work starts pilling up, so the ability to schedule sleep time could help improve my sleeping habits. 

## Domain Problems
From here, I'll be discussing different problems I considered from the highlighted domains and would like to note that they'll be layed out as "problem" (domain) to highlight the problem being discussed and its associated domain.

### Problems Considered

#### Scheduling Homework (Classwork): 
    Scheduling times to do homework would be a useful feature for students. Allowing them to manage their time with greater ease. I excluded this problem due to the insufficient differentiation from other event organizers like google calender. Additionally, people would likely be indifferent due to having to be flexible with times as sudden events can occur. 
    

#### Remembering Class Lecture Times(Classwork):
    Remebering the time for lecture would help students in their daily lives by giving them specific times to attend lecture. Similarly, this was excluded due to the insufficient differentiation from other event organizers like google calender.

#### Managing Kitchen Ingredients (Community Management):
    Within my community, managing the kitchen ingredients would allow for easier creation of grocery lists and making sure each cooking team gets the correct ingredients at the right amount. However, this problem was not considered further due to the effects indifference would have. It would require work from cooking teams and grocery buyers to manage ingredient levels and if some people forget or care not for updating the amount of ingredients to whole system would fail. This could also be considered an impact from a lack of critical mass.

#### Managing Saves (Community Management):
    In my community, we have a 'save system' where a person could ask for a food save to eat later in case they cannot arrive to dinner. However, the current system can be chaotic as a flood of messages with different wordings can confuse the cooking team. This idea was excluded as implementing a system to manage the saves could be met with indifference from people, and they would continue to send a flood of messages. This system would only create more chaos if met with indifference.

#### Finding reliable Carpool Riders (Carpooling): 
    This essentially refers to rating other people who you carpool with in an attempt to improve reliability when carpooling. This was swiftly excluded as it would recieve a serious amount of backlash from people who would not want to be rated. Additionally, it could have the unintended consequence of being another avenue of online bullying.

#### Fair cost division (Carpooling):
    When carpooling, it all ends up coming down to the issue of splitting the cost, but some people are more reluctanct to pay, especially after the service has been provided. This issue was excluded due to the issues of overambition as asking people to offer the payment to a third-party creates a feeling of distrust. 


### Focus Problems

#### Managing Classes (Classwork)

Managing classes is one of, if not the greatest, issues students face because proper time management is a tough skill for people to pick up.

Evidence: 
- [How incoming college students can develop time-management skills](https://www.ctinsider.com/waterbury/opinion/article/college-students-time-management-20379282.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com):
This article talks about the crucial skill of time management 

- [Planning Time Management in School Activities and Relation to Procrastination: A Study for Educational Sustainability](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/16/6883?utm_source=chatgpt.com): 

- [Canvas](https://web.mit.edu/canvas/): Canvas is a tool used by various universities to provide students with information on their classes.

Features: 
- Class summary: Creating summaries of class room expectations. This would aid in remembering office hour times, late policies, and pset dates.
- OH Calender: Having a calender dedicated to reminding the user of when and where office hours for classes are held. This would help users plan ahead to attend the office hours for aid.
- Work List: A dedicated list where you can add the due date and assignment name, aiding in the process of prioritizing work.

Stakeholders: Students (users), Friends(affected by users management), Professors (Judge if the information is sufficient). Impact: Students and their Friends will suffer if unable to immediatly find a specific piece of info. However, Professors will judge whether the information that remains is sufficient.


#### Assigning Chores (Community Management):
In a living community, the ability to maintain a clean space is crucial to a healthy home. However, it can be difficult to assign people chores and expect them to complete them.

Evidence:
- [Consequences of Neglecting House Clean](https://www.qbclean.com/10-nasty-things-that-happen-when-you-neglect-house-cleaning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com): This articles talks about the importance of mainting a clean living space, promoting the creation of a chore management system.
- [Co-op Magic: Lessons for creating thriving communities](https://medium.com/we-are-hearken/lessons-for-thriving-organizations-from-co-op-living-c9711cc4d550?utm_source=chatgpt.com): A working chore system is highlighted in this article, showing that a chore system can work if implemented properly.
- [Cybernetic Governance in a Coliving House](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17113): This article highlights the efficiency of a chore system in a living community and its success in mainting the living space clean and lively.

Features: 
- Chore calender: Creating a chores calendar where residents are informed of their chores would allow people to remember their chores, preventing people from forgetting.
- Chore rotater: A system that properly rotates chores between residents would allow people to complete a variety of chores, avoiding the issue of getting assigned the same chore and recieve one they may prefer.
- Insentive system: Creating a system where people are incentivezed to complete their chores would discourage people from not doing their chores. Incentives would have to vary by household, but in our living group it would likely be House points.

Stakeholders: Member(People who live in the household, completing the chores), Visitor (People who will visit), Person interested in the household. Impact: Members and Visistors will suffer from a faulty chore system. Similarly, People interested in living in the community will either be swayed away if the living conditions are poor. 

#### Finding carpools (Carpooling)
Finding carpools towards the airport can be difficult due to the lack of openness towards sharing a ride with others. 

Evidence:
- [Could Bay Areaâ€™s traffic nightmares bring back casual carpool?](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/traffic-casual-carpool-20218379.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com): The ability to carpool even with people you may not exactly know is highlighted.
- [Why traditional carpooling apps struggle with daily commutes](https://pavecommute.app/why-traditional-carpooling-apps-struggle-with-daily-commutes/): This article talks about how carpooling fails from issues such as availability and reliability.
- [Car-pooling is a simple fix for our broken city transport systems](https://www.wired.com/story/city-transport-car-pooling/?utm_source=chatgpt.com): This article highlights the effects of the pandemic on the probability of casual rideshare, highlighting how incentives may need to be implemented.

Features:
- Ride Board: A general board where people can post when and where they plan to ride to could aid others in finding a carpool.
- Ride Reservations: The ability to reserve a spot on a carpool would guarantee people have a proper ride to a destination. 
- Identification Check: Making sure that a user is a student to safely join together for a ride.

Stakeholders: Carpoolers (people willing to share a ride), Rideshare services (Companies involved in the access of rideshare services), Friends(People who are impacted by carpoolers). Impact: Carpoolers suffer when others don't share if they will leave to the airport at a similar time. Rideshare companies will prefer users to get a ride in smaller groups to maximize profits. In contrast, Friends may join in seeing that the price of the carpool is split amongst more people.
